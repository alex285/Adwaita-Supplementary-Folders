# Adwaita-Supplementary-Folders
A theme that inherits official [GNOME Adwaita icon theme](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme), and it only adds some additional folder colors to be used with [Nautilus Folders Icons Plugin](https://github.com/bilelmoussaoui/nautilus-folder-icons).

That theme won't break anything from Adwaita, and I made it mostly for my own use, since I really really want to be able to colorize the folders. I also opened a [bug report in GNOME Files](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/issues/817), but **it died painfully <3**

# Installation
Just clone the repo and move it on `~/.local/share/icons/`

In one command:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/alex285/Adwaita-Supplementary-Folders ~/.local/share/icons/Adwaita-Colors
```
Then select it from GNOME Tweak Theme

# Colors
Colors are from [Material Design Palette](https://materialuicolors.co/), and I used
1. 500 for Main
2. 700 for Top
3. 200 for Border
4. Black for Shadows

# TODO - Bugs
Small sizes are missing, so it doesn't look good with rest Adwaita folders, but at least work with largest size on Nautilus List view :)
